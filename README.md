Collection of scripts and configs for my Ultra.cc seedbox

Tools from the community are included in this repo as git submodules. For each tool, I have included my own configuration files and scripts. This repo is intended to be a one-stop shop for all the tools I use on my seedbox.
I do not take credit for any of the tools included in this repo. Please refer to the original authors for support and questions.

My own tools are included in the scripts directory and are licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
